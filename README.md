Using a time series analysis the goal of this project is to create a temperature forcast for London in the future

# Project Goal
- To create a time series model that will forcast temperature 2 years in the future
- Create a final notebook containing the results

# Initial Thoughts
- I believe that sales should be able to be forcasted using the Holt Winters method
- Will use a variety of methods to find the best forcast for future sales
